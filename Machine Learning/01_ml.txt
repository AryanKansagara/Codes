ML is a subset of AI

AI: the efforts to automate the intellectual tasks performed by humans

Machine Learning takes the data and takes the output and then figures out the rules for us

Goal for Machine Learning Models : Highest accuracy possible

Machine Learning summary: Rather than giving the program the rules an algorithm finds the rules itself

-----------------------------------

AI<-ML<-NN(nueral network)

Neural Network: A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data 

------------------------------------

Feature => The information used by us to predict something
Label=> Something we are looking to predict or you can say the output

---------------------------------------

Different types of Machine Learning:
-Unsupervised Learning
-Supervised Learning
-Reinforcement Learning
